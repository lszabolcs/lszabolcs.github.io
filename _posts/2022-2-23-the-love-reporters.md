This website serves as a portfolio and blog for "The Love Reporters," specializing in wedding and couples' photography. Its main functions are to showcase their work, detail services, share blog content, and facilitate client contact.

## Technical Overview
- __Platform:__ Built on WordPress with a custom-developed theme.
- __Styling:__ Uses SCSS for styling, likely following a modular (e.g., BEM-like) approach.
- __Content Management:__ Leverages the WordPress Block Editor (Gutenberg) extensively, featuring both built-in and custom-developed blocks (e.g., for collages, CTAs, service listings) to structure content dynamically.
- __Layout:__ Employs modern CSS techniques, primarily CSS Grid for major page structures and Flexbox for component alignment, ensuring a responsive design across devices.

## Core Plugin Integration
- __Advanced Custom Fields (ACF):__ Used to add structured custom data fields to posts, pages, and custom post types, enabling richer content management (e.g., specific details for gallery items or services).
- __Custom Post Type UI (CPT UI):__ Facilitates the creation and management of custom post types (e.g., "Galleries," "Services") for better content organization beyond standard posts and pages.
- __Contact Form 7:__ Powers the website's contact forms, enabling seamless communication with visitors.
- __Lazy Blocks:__ Employed for creating the custom Gutenberg blocks, allowing for tailored content elements that fit the site's unique design and functional requirements.

This setup results in a visually appealing, highly customized, and manageable website that effectively showcases "The Love Reporters" services and portfolio.
